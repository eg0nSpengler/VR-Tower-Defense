# VR-Tower-Defense

This is an VR Tower Defense game created in collabration with [Vivian](https://github.com/Vivian-A) over the period of about a month.

It was done primarily to get familiar with the SteamVR/Oculus APIs in Unity and for fun.

This project is from August 2019 but I recently decided to toss it here on Github before I stash it away somewhere in the depths of my drives to never be rediscovered.

# FAQ

*What's up with the dev textures and block monsters?*

We're programmers not artists, we're here to make things function quick and smoothly not look good ;)
